This is about getting my intention for this project down in black and white in its most simple terms.

The aim is to start an open source design and marketing collective that is successful financially and with more important metrics.

It's purpose is to address this problem:

---
### **whats the point doing anything environmentally or politically? it seems impossible to make a difference**
---
#### The objectives I have in mind are currently quite personal although there's even more personal objectives in my profile README:
1. I approach this project like putting together a band.
2. Make flyers and other marketing goods and products, t-shirts, posters and business cards in gimp.
3. Find the community I want to work with.
4. Beat catitalism
5. Ask for help.
6. Have fun.
7. Get all punk with it :fire: :fire: :fire:

The only other two things I want to put in at this point is starting a todo list of next steps and people who I want to contact and why I'm reaching out.

- [x] do a basic write up of the projext

- [ ] write a list of people to contact

- [ ] re-write the basic write up...
