I wanted to get started on this and hopefully reverse engineer it so I can input from vim and ssh it over.

I have a lot to learn, not only that but markdown I'm not totally ok with, doing a half decent website, or github page to start with.

This is about getting my intention around this project down in black and white in its most simple terms.

This is a design based project and here I wish to make my vision clear but also state my design constraints.
Beyond that I'm looking for incremental improvements and asking for help, probably a lot.

I'm going to list the people who's work I'm really digging (to ask for help), why I like their work and connect even here on github if that's a thing to do.
Connection is what I really want to do though.

This is a place where I can learn this stuff, get good at this stuff and connect with people, ask for help with my mission - form a band if you like.

It's a punk band where you make cool shit you like making and sell it, I really want to make a bad man brand around it all - that's my creative project beyond the few simple gimp created ideas and designs I have.

I want to make it really easy to run design sprints and run a bunch of them, for the collective wealth of the participents, sure, but to also make enough value to make a fantastic organization that can help various causes, especially environmental ones and make a difference in the world.

I want to beat capitalism on a personal level by doing work I love to do and as far beyond that as is possible.
I want to be the most successful entrepreneur in the third web and there's quite a lot there I want to nail down including my definition of success, entrepreneurism and what I mean by the third web.
