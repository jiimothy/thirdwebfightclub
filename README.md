This is about setting intention for a project in super minimal but public terms.

**The aim is to start a successful open source design and marketing collective.**

It's purpose is to address this oversized problem (at least in part):

---
### **whats the point doing anything environmentally or politically? it seems impossible to make a difference**
---
#### The objectives I have in mind:
1. Approach this project like putting together a band.
2. Get all creative with gimp, make, give away or sell t-shirts, posters, cards, flyers and any other marketing goods I think would look cool.
3. Do a website/github page and make it look really nice.
4. Find the community I want to work with.
5. Beat capitalism on a micro level and support other people to do it too.
6. Ask for help alot.
7. Have fun.
8. Get all punk with it.
9. Create a brand a brand unlike any other (in a good way).

The only other things I want to put in at this point is starting a todo list of next steps and people who I want to contact, their background and why?

---
**TODO'S**

- [x] do a minimal, basic write up of the project

- [ ] write a list of 10 people/organisations to contact

- [ ] re-write the write up... expand, more details.

- [ ] do a presentation - proto brand designs.

---
**CONTACT WHO?**

- [ ] hunt the moon - help with t-shirts etc

- [ ] common objective - more of the same.

- [ ] caravan coffee - I got this idea...

- [ ] spacemesh - I like your emails.

- [ ] Pimoroni - The coolest.
